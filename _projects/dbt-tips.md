## Why dbt-tips?

dbt-tips is my effort to keep track of resources and concepts I might want to
revisit. The dbt community is awesome and active. At any given time, there's
more interesting ideas or content than one person can keep up with.

dbt-tips has the following resources:

* Interesting articles and guides
* Toolbox - the packages and tools I can't live without
* Beginner resources for those new to the dbt ecosystem
* dbt CLI command line reference
* Materialization reference for snapshots and incremental models
* General command line and git tips useful for large projects
* Jinja reference
* dbt-specific Jinja reference
